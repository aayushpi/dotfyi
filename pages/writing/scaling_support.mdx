      If you're building a new platform team, your customers are going to go
      through many changes. In the case of a design system, tools, hacks, and
      practices that made your team wildly successful are also the cause of long
      term design and technical debt. Making corrective changes to mitigate
      these problems with a platform can often mean taking away these legos.
      Although this is positive, you're playing with feelings and agency. And
      the way you communicate these changes and support people in the transition
      can be the differentiator between success and rejection.{" "}

      was incubated and eventually scaled organization wide. Here are some of
      the ways we scaled our support, helping our customers and ourselves
      through these stages.

      Stage 1: Support as incubation
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      In 2018, we didn’t have a design system at Twilio. This meant that the
      most efficient way to express a UI solution involved copying older
      implementations and adopting popular code snippets and packages. In and of
      itself, this was fine: however, it did create situations where a UI
      compromise was necessary.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Since we were just incubating and weren't fully staffed or bought-in by
      the organization, we took small steps. One such step was the creation of a
      *help* slack channel. Here, no matter what your UI question was, we'd
      attempt to solve it. What's more, we wanted to solve it quickly. While
      this approach didn't allow for the best answer for each experience, it did
      allow us to take diving catches that built trust with designers, PMs, and
      engineers.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This support model worked as intended. Over the years, engagement in this
      slack channel increased. Front-end engineers and product designers
      organically found community and the best possible way to solve a problem.
      This whet the appetite for a design systems team, and provided enough
      evidence to make key hires could <em>actually</em> build a system.

      Stage 2: Support as we scaled
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Fast forward about a year, and Paste was at the foot of a steep adoption
      curve. Unlike our legacy libraries (which had larger, more complex
      monolithic components), we had moved to an approach of small, accessible,
      and composable pieces of kit that could be mixed and matched. Designers
      and engineers were beginning to use the system in their UIs. As they went
      about this, there was a lot of learning and undoing of old habits that was
      necessary. We started getting a lot of questions around component usage,
      accessibility, composition, UI reviews, etc. Answering these questions
      took some time, and as we saw 20+ questions a day, the four person team
      began to feel it.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This was a good problem to have: customers were buying in to the design
      system at a pace that was greater than anticipated. However, this meant
      that we were increasingly devoting more time to support rather than new
      development. This put a dent in our shipping velocity but1 more
      importantly affected team health: support is hard and often a thankless
      job. To mitigate these problems, we investigated why our support model was
      failing at scale:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        The immediacy of Slack meant it was easier for people to get answers to
        their questions through a Slack message than go to the doc site to look
        for an answer.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Slack messages are ephemeral and teams around the world would routinely
        wake up to a host of new information that they’d just not see, leading
        to repeated questions.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        The quality of incoming requests was affected by the medium: “My build
        broke, can you help?” instead of “My build (screenshot attached) failed,
        I am currently doing <em>x</em>, and tried to do <em>y</em>”
      </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      A change was necessary: we needed to evolve our discussions from "What's
      fast and cheap?" to "What's right?". To address the rising tide of support
      questions, the team stepped back from answering every question and made
      some changes:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        We improved documentation structure based on feedback. This included a
        greater focus on examples and do's and don'ts.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        We began a rotating helper model for the team to lead support
        conversations through the week. This allowed the majority of the team to
        focus on work, while mentally preparing our weekly support helper to
        embrace conversations with service mindset.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        We also made a <strong>big change</strong> to how we support teams by
        moving all conversations from Slack to GitHub discussions.
      </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      The last change was particularly significant: moving the support model
      from Slack to a new platform was more than a minor inconvenience. To many,
      it was a breach of trust that the system was founded on. Managing how our
      users felt about this change was an important criteria for success. We’d
      need to inform people of the change, and then remind them of it enough
      till the habit was broken and remade. And we had to hope that in all of
      this, they still trusted us.

      How we announced it

    <Paragraph>
      We made the support official at an All Hands meeting. But, keeping this
      change from unraveling meant a consistent change in team and customer
      behavior: <em>we’d need to be persistent</em>. We had to politely, but
      firmly say no to every request unless it came from the right channel. This
      also made it a <strong>feelings</strong> management problem: it was hard
      to have a team that had once routinely said <em>yes, and</em> to every
      request, now point to an external URL for any help.

    <Paragraph>
      We addressed new users first: using Slack’s <Link href="//slack.com/features/workflow-automation" passHref>
        <Anchor showExternal>
          Workflow Builder
        </Anchor>
      </Link>, I built a
      bot that DM’d anyone who joined our Slack channel for the first time with
      a greeting, important information, and link to our support and documentation. While
      this helped, we still had hundreds of people still active in the channel
      with a previous social contract.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To guide our existing customers, I built another bot: this one was a
      little less discrete. For every new question that showed up in Slack, it
      posted a response suggesting the user redirect this question to a support
      channel.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We sweated the details of this bot's message and tone. It had to be
      polite, sufficiently firm, and also provide reasons why we were making
      this change. For example, the bot responded to a slack reaction that's
      used company wide to positively promote the value of better documentation. We also included an
      escalation path for the truly rare request that needed urgent
      intervention: while the chances of needing to hit this button were extremely rare, it
      gave customers peace of mind in knowing that a short circuit still
      existed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We called this bot the <em>Paste Concierge</em>. It launched two months
      ago and we paid keen attention to how customers might react to it. Our largest customer persona (front-end engineers) took to the GitHub model easily. However, it
      took a while to convince designers and other users to sign up for GitHub just to engage with
      the system. We held firm with this new support model, and here’s what
      we’ve observed so far:
    </Paragraph>
    <OrderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Slack support requests have dropped from 20+ a day to ~1 a week. Some of
        these are redirected to GitHub, but others are managed directly.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        GitHub discussions did <em>not</em> proportionally increase to 20+ a
        day, which was a net-win for ticket deflection 🎉. One hypothesis for this is customers are more willing to try a
        few things out if the immediacy of Slack is not available.
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      While the Paste Concierge clearly helped, there's still more work to be done with design system support at Twilio. In the year
      ahead, we hope to:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Make support more conversational, and less transactional: each support
        question should influence the design and direction of the system.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Our conversations are still mostly <em>public DMs</em>, and not true
        discussions. This isn't ideal: like any design problem, involving
        diverse perspectives usually leads to better outcomes.

      The UX and UI that we ship is dynamic and changes with time. So should our
      support models. Healthy design systems respond to the world around them—
      whether it's making space to switch off when we're sheltered in place, time off
      for direct or political action, or surging for important deadlines like
      launches. In each of these cultural situations, consider the success of
      your support to not be about the answer itself, but the process in which
      your customer gets there, and how your team feels about it.
