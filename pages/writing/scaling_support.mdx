      Here's a situation you might encounter while building a design system (or
      any platform) where there was none before: you'll begin your journey by{" "}
      <Link href="//www.paulgraham.com/" passHref>
        <Anchor>doing things that don't scale</Anchor>
      </Link>
      . Then at a certain inflection point, a change will be necessary: it might
      be technical or procedural, but is almost always <strong>also</strong> cultural.
      We saw this as the design systems teams was incubated and eventually scaled
      organization wide.

      Stage 1: Support as incubation
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      In 2018, we didn’t have a design system at Twilio. This meant that the
      most efficient way to express a UI solution involved copying older
      implementations and adopting popular code snippets and packages. In and of
      itself, this was fine: however, it did create situations where a UI
      compromise was necessary.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Since we were just incubating and weren't fully staffed or bought-in by
      the organization, we took small steps. One such step was the creation of a
      *help* slack channel. Here, no matter what your UI question was, we'd
      attempt to solve it. What's more, we wanted to solve it quickly. While
      this approach didn't allow for the best answer for each experience, it did
      allow us to take diving catches that built trust with designers, PMs, and
      engineers.

      Stage 2: Support as we scaled
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Fast forward about a year, and Paste was just about begging a steep
      adoption curve. Unlike our legacy libraries (which had larger, more
      complex monolithic components), we had moved to an approach of small,
      accessible, and composable pieces that could be mixed and matched. As
      designers and engineers were beginning to use the system as a baseline for
      their UIs. In doing so, there was a lot of relearning and undoing old
      habits. We started getting increasingly complex questions around
      accessibility, composition, UI reviews, and of course Typescript errors.
      We’d see upwards of 10 questions a day, and the team began to feel it.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To do so, we investigated why our support model was failing at scale:
    </Paragraph>
    <UnorderedList>
      <ListItem>
        The *immediacy* of Slack meant it was easier for people to get answers
        to their questions through a Slack message than go to the doc site to
        look for an answer.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Slack messages are ephemeral and teams around the world would routinely
        wake up to a host of new information that they’d just not see, leading
        to repeated questions.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        The quality of incoming requests was affected by the medium: “My build
        broke can you help?” instead of “My build (screenshot attached) failed,
        I am currently doing _x_, and tried to do _y_”
      </ListItem>
    </UnorderedList>
    <Separator orientation="horizontal" verticalSpacing="space50" />
    <Paragraph>
      A change was necessary: we needed to evolve our discussions from "What's
      fast and cheap?" to "What's right?"
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To address the rising tide of support questions, the team stepped back. We
      set up better structures for documentation, assigned rotating helpers who
      led support conversations through the week, and moved all support
      conversations from Slack to GitHub discussions.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Except, our customers still expected support on Slack.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This was a cultural change: moving the support model from Slack to a new
      platform was at the very least, a significant inconvenience. At worst, it
      was a breach of trust that the system was founded on. Managing how our
      users felt about this change was an important criteria for success. We’d
      need to inform people of the change, and then remind them of it enough
      till the habit was broken and remade. And we had to hope that in all of
      this, they still trusted us.

      How we announced it

    <Paragraph>
      We made the change official by announcing a new support model at an All
      Hands meeting. It was made alongside many positive announcements. That
      helped absorb the initial blow, but was also missed by quite a few folks.
      Keeping this change going meant we’d need to be persistent. support We’d
      need to politely, but firmly say no to every request unless it came from
      the right channel. That being said, design systems are also *feelings*
      management: it was hard to have a team that routinely said *yes, and* to
      every request now point to an external URL for any help.

    <Paragraph>
      We addressed new users first: using Slack’s workflow builder, I built a
      bot that DM’d anyone who joined our Slack channel for the first time with
      a greeting, important information, and a link to our support area.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      And while that helped, we knew that we still had hundreds of people still
      active in the channel with a previous social contract.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To remedy this, we built another bot: This one was a little less discrete.
      For every new question that showed up in Slack, it posted a response
      suggesting the user redirect this question to a support channel.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We sweated the details on the copy of this. It had to be polite,
      sufficiently firm and also provide reasons why we were making this change.
      We also included an escalation path: while the chances of hitting this
      button are extremely rare (given that our design system does not directly
      deploy to customers), it did give customers peace of mind in knowing that
      urgent requests were still handled in this channel.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      For a number of reasons, this couldn’t be automatic: we set it to respond
      to an emoji reaction as a trigger. Since we’re mostly picky, we sweated on
      the perfect reaction too: it can’t be snarky, it can’t be rude: it had to
      convey the message that we’re doing this for a higher bar of
      documentation. So we turned to one of our favorite Twilio company values:
      Write It Ddown. By using it as an emoji, we framed the redirection as an
      application of company values, and not personal hubris.

      We launched this about two months ago. Here’s what we’ve observed so far:
